# Protein Design Labs Dashboard

A curated, interactive directory of protein design research groups worldwide.

## Overview

This project transforms a static list of protein design labs into a dynamic, searchable, and filterable dashboard. It allows researchers and students to easily find labs based on:

-   **Institution**
-   **Principal Investigator (PI)**
-   **Country**

## Features

-   **Interactive Dashboard**: Clean, modern interface for browsing labs.
-   **Search & Filter**: Real-time filtering by PI name, institution, or country.
-   **Regional Statistics**: View the distribution of labs across top regions (e.g., North America, China, EMEA).
-   **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.
-   **Data Visualization**: At-a-glance statistics on total labs and countries represented.

## Usage

This is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can view it directly in your browser.
